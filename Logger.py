DUAL-CHANNEL CONSOLE AND FILE LOGGER
================================================================================
Author      : Breno Farias da Silva
Created     : 2025-12-11
Description :
    Provides a stream-compatible logger that mirrors program output to the active
    terminal and to an ANSI-clean UTF-8 log file. It is used by the project entry
    point to preserve live console output while recording complete experiment logs.

    Key features include:
        - Mirrors stdout and stderr messages to the console and a persistent log file.
        - Removes ANSI terminal escape sequences from the file copy only.
        - Flushes output immediately and supports common stream inspection methods.

Usage:
    1. Import Logger from the repository-root Logger.py module.
    2. Create an instance with Logger.create(path, clean=True).
    3. Assign the instance to sys.stdout and sys.stderr.

Outputs:
    - Writes cleaned console output to the configured log file.
    - Preserves the same output on the original console stream.

TODOs:
    - None identified.

Dependencies:
    - Python standard library.

Assumptions & Notes:
    - The logger does not close or otherwise manage the original terminal stream.
    - File writes are serialized with a re-entrant lock for safe callback output.
