GRU DDOS DETECTION ON CICDDOS2019 ORCHESTRATOR
================================================================================
Author      : Breno Farias da Silva
Created     : 2026-09-14
Description :
    Provides the top-level entry point for the modular CICDDoS2019 multi-class GRU reconstruction of Ramzan et al. (2023). The entry point configures
    dual console/file logging, registers a cross-platform completion notification,
    parses and validates the existing CLI, and delegates the experiment to the modular
    project workflow without changing the model or dataset-processing logic.

    Key features include:
        - Mirrors stdout and stderr to the console and logs/main.log.
        - Registers .assets/Sounds/NotificationSound.wav through atexit.
        - Delegates the complete reproduction workflow to gru_ddos_detection.workflow.

Usage:
    1. Configure dataset and output paths through the Makefile variables or CLI options.
    2. Execute make run-mac, make run-linux, or python main.py --data-dir PATH [options].
    3. Review experiment artifacts below --output-dir and runtime output in logs/main.log.

Outputs:
    - Writes the complete runtime console stream to logs/main.log.
    - Writes experiment outputs below the configured --output-dir directory.
    - Plays the bundled completion sound when a supported system audio command is available.

TODOs:
    - None identified.

Dependencies:
    - Python standard library.
    - Logger.py.
    - gru_ddos_detection.cli.
    - gru_ddos_detection.workflow.

Assumptions & Notes:
    - Raw CICDDoS2019 CSV files remain read-only and are verified by the workflow.
    - Completion-sound failures are non-fatal, including headless Linux audio failures.
    - Relative and absolute output-path behavior remains controlled by the existing CLI.
